# Numerical-Analysis

Basic numerical algorithms realized in Matlab, including

1. Solve one varibale equation using bisection, secant, Muller's, Newton's and false position methods;
2. Interpolation using clamped cubic spline algorithm;
3. Integral using composite trapzoidal and composite Simpson;
4. Linear system equation using 1)Gaussian elimination with scaled partial Pivoting; 2) Guass_Siedel iteration
5. Nonlinear system equation using fixed point iteration.
6. Others like steepest descent method to calculate the minima of n variables function.
